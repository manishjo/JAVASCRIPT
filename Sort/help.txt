Usage: sort [OPTION]... [FILE]...
Write sorted concatenation of all FILE(s) to standard output.

  -c               check if given files already sorted, do not sort
  -i               consider only [\040-\0176] characters in keys
  -k POS1[,POS2]   start a key at POS1, end it *at* POS2
                     field numbers and character offsets are numbered
                     starting with one (contrast with zero-based +POS form)
  -n               compare according to string numerical value, imply -b
  -r               reverse the result of comparisons
  -t SEP           use SEParator instead of non- to whitespace transition
      --help       display this help and exit
      --version    output version information and exit

POS is F[.C][OPTS], where F is the field number and C the character position
in the field, both counted from one with -k, from zero with the obsolescent
form.  OPTS is made up of one or more of Mbdfinr; this effectively disables
global -Mbdfinr settings for that key.  If no key is given, use the entire
line as the key.  With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.

Release notes:
  * This program does not supports alphanumeric values.
  * This program does not supports unequal data.
