Simple runing program.

make a program which can sort column in a file or data by default by space* and if

process user input 
	map
	-k = To start from a column.
	-r = Reverse the result of comparision. 
	-n = compare the string by number.
	-c = cheak if given files are already sorted.
	-t = Use sapreater instead of default delimiter.
