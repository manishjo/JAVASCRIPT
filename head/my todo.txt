[done]Analyze the problem

[done]1-we have to create a "simple running program" which can print frist 10 lines or given numbers lines of each file to standard output.

[done]2-we will create a txt file which will contain multiple lines text.

[done]3-first of all we will create a .js file, name "head.js".

[done]4- we will make a function name user_input which will take user input as command line for the program
	9.1- example:-
				node head.js abc.txt
				          or
				node head.js -4 abc.txt

[done]5- we will create function name "catch_line".

[done]6- we will take the file name and will cheak that is that file exits or not

[done]7-if file will exits we will read and store the content of the file in a variable 

[done]8-now for printing lines we will use a loop and a counter which will cont for line break in the stored text of the file up to the number given by user .

[done]9-if user has given line number my function will print line till that outherwise it will by default print starting 10 lines of a file.

[done]10- we will use diffreant commands from switch case from command line such as,
		10.1- 
		[done]-c, --bytes=SIZE         print first SIZE bytes
		[done]-n, --lines=NUMBER       print first NUMBER lines instead of first 10
		[done]-q, --quiet, --silent    never print headers giving file names
		[done]-v, --verbose            always print headers giving file names
    		[done]--help               display this help and exit

[done]10-we will make a function "help" in which we will show the help content to the user.

[done]11-for that copy the content of help command when used in bash for head and make a txt file with that and excess that file from help function.
		11.1- node head.js --h
		output:- the whole message of help.
	 
it takes only one file name

10-example:-
		text in file:-
			helloo my name is manish
			i am a intern at thoughtworks
			i am going great guns in programming
			its fun !
		command:- node head.js -2 abc.txt
		output:-
			helloo my name is manish
			i am a intern at thoughtworks

[done]11-test cases:-
				1- does it works for multiple blank lines.
				2- .txt file is not there.
				3- user has not given file name.
				4- if no lines are defined,
